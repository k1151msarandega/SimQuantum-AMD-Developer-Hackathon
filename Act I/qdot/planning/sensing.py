========================
Active Sensing Policy — information-theoretic measurement selection.

Replaces the hackathon's fixed Ct_low / Ct_high thresholds (blueprint §7.1: removed).

For each candidate modality, computes:
    score = I(belief; measurement) / cost(measurement)
Where I is estimated expected mutual information (entropy reduction).

Returns a typed MeasurementPlan (from qdot.core.types) that the
TranslationAgent converts into a DeviceAdapter call.

Cost model (blueprint §5.4):
    LINE_SCAN   → 128 points
    COARSE_2D   → 256 points  (16×16)
    LOCAL_PATCH → 1024 points (32×32)
    FINE_2D     → 4096 points (64×64)
